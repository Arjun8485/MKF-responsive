                    Madhavi Kapur is a homegrown educationist, who believes in applying common sense and indigenous wisdom to the modern globalizing world. She strives towards building bridges between the past and the future, rural and urban children, the 'haves' and the 'have-nots', the east and the west in a healthy cross fertilization of ideas. Her experiments and experiences have met with resounding praise from students and their parents who have been inspired by her work.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1986, she set up her first school - S.P.M. English School in the city of Pune. Together with her group of professional educationists, she innovated with prevailing systems, adapting textbook theories and the latest research to the unique environment of urbanizing India. The year 1995 witnessed her break new ground when, along with her team, she took the process forward by establishing a more developed institution - the Rewachand Bhojwani Academy - which, in time, has become a relevant and replicable model. In 2001, Ms. Kapur founded an educational trust THE MADHAVI KAPUR FOUNDATION - for the replication and scaling out of her work, so as to impact the wider educational system. She is the strong pillar of all the work of the Foundation and continues to be an inspiration to all many teachers and students alike.

                    Anjali tai began her association with Adi in 1989. She initially was only a parent but Adi was able to identify in her an eagerness to teach using Adi’s innovative and experience based teaching methodology, and so asked her to be a Marathi teacher. Adi didn’t give much importance to qualifications and degrees, rather seeking out people who showed an enthusiasm to teach and learn, and bought into her philosophies of education. Once they were part of the school community they were always encouraged to study further. In 1998 Anjali tai received an award from NCERT for the teaching methodologies she used in her classroom with non-marathi speaking children.

                    At Aman Setu, Anjali tai is the Director of Interface and she works with parents, students and teachers alike.
